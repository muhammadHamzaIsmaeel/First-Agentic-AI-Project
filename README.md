# Agentic AI Assistant

This is my first Agentic AI project developed as part of the Governor House IT Course. The project implements an intelligent AI assistant using the `agents` library in Python, integrated with a generative AI model. The assistant is designed to process natural language queries and perform tasks using custom tools, such as a mathematical calculator.

## Features
- **Conversational AI Agent**: Built using the `agents` library to handle user queries interactively.
- **Custom Calculator Tool**: Includes a `calculate_numbers` tool that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with robust error handling.
- **Secure Configuration**: Uses `python-dotenv` to manage API keys securely via environment variables.
- **Efficient Project Management**: Utilizes `uv` for dependency management and virtual environment setup.
- **Modular Design**: Structured with `RunConfig` and `Agent` components for scalability and reusability.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `uv` (Python package and environment manager)
- A valid API key for a generative AI model (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI)
- A `.env` file with your API key

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-assistant.git
   cd agentic-ai-assistant
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure `pyproject.toml` is configured, then run:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Configure API Key**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:
   ```
   gemini_api_key=your_actual_gemini_api_key
   # or
   openai_api_key=your_actual_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uv run src/explore_uv/main.py
   ```

2. **Example Queries**:
   - Mathematical operations:
     ```bash
     Calculate 5 + 3
     # Expected output: 8.0
     ```
     ```bash
     Calculate 10 / 2
     # Expected output: 5.0
     ```
   - Note: The current implementation does not support real-time weather queries. For weather data, consider integrating an external API like OpenWeatherMap.

3. **Customizing the Agent**:
   - Modify the `instructions` in `Agent` to change the assistant's behavior.
   - Add new tools by defining functions with the `@function_tool` decorator.
